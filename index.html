			<p>
				<div class="col-xs-6 stuff">
					I was born in Vancouver to my American-born father and Canadian Mother. I am of Russian Jewish descent. In my teens I got into comedy and participated in some competitions. Later in my life I starred in a TV show called “Freaks and Geeks” where I played Ken Miller. It launched my acting and writing career. Now I am one of the most well-know actors in Hollywood.

					<ul>
						<li><strong>Superbad:</strong> I think it was one of the funniest films I ever made, it reminded me of my highschool days</li>
						<li><strong>This is the End:</strong> It was where I got to just go nuts! It made fun of hollywood as a whole and showed the ridiculousness of religion</li>
						<li><strong>Steve Jobs:</strong> I do think that I have worked on better movies, but this one is special because it’s not a comedy. This film is closer to a documentary, but I think that it was one of my more meaningful films.</li>

			<h1 class="page-header">My Impact</h1>
			
			<p>
				<div class="col-xs-6 stuff">
					While some of my movies only served their purpose for comedy, some made a difference. My movie “The Interview” really did make an impact. The plot was about a TV producer (Me) and a talk show host (Jame Franco) who get an interview with Kim Jong Un. We are then recruited by the CIA to assassinate him. The North Korean government threatened to declare war if the film was released to the general public. There was even a group that hacked into Sony’s servers forcing them to release the film. Most all of my movies don’t a direct impact on the world, but most do still try to make a difference. It may not be obvious, but most of my movies have a deeper meaning behind the comedy. Sausage party is one of the movies with the strongest message. The plot is about grocery items who are sentient in a grocery store. They believe that when they are bought they go to food heaven, and are completely oblivious to the fact that they will be killed in brutal ways. IT really talks about how religion can have detrimental effects on society when they believe that there is a better life after death.

						<li><strong>Coming in second in a Vancouver Amateur Comedy Contest:</strong> it showed me that I could do something with comedy and that it wasn't some hobby that would eventually be abandoned</li>
						<li><strong>Judd Apatow:</strong> he directed the works that made me an actor like "Knocked Up" and ...</li>
						<li><strong>Freaks and Geeks:</strong> it was my first major acting gig and it led to my acting and comedy career</li>
