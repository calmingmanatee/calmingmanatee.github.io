				<div class="col-xs-6 stuff">
					I was born in Vancouver to my American-born father and Canadian Mother. I am of Russian Jewish descent. In my teens I got into comedy and participated in some competitions. Later in my life I starred in a TV show called “Freaks and Geeks” where I played Ken Miller. It launched my acting and writing career. Now I am one of the most well-know actors in Hollywood.

						<li><strong>Superbad:</strong> I think it was one of the funniest films I ever made, it reminded me of my highschool days</li>
						<li><strong>This is the End:</strong> It was where I got to just go nuts! It made fun of hollywood as a whole and showed the ridiculousness of religion</li>
						<li><strong>Steve Jobs:</strong> I do think that I have worked on better movies, but this one is special because it’s not a comedy. This film is closer to a documentary, but I think that it was one of my more meaningful films.</li>

				<div class="col-xs-6 stuff">
					While some of my movies only served their purpose for comedy, some made a difference. My movie “The Interview” really did make an impact. The plot was about a TV producer (Me) and a talk show host (Jame Franco) who get an interview with Kim Jong Un. We are then recruited by the CIA to assassinate him. The North Korean government threatened to declare war if the film was released to the general public. There was even a group that hacked into Sony’s servers forcing them to release the film. Most all of my movies don’t a direct impact on the world, but most do still try to make a difference. It may not be obvious, but most of my movies have a deeper meaning behind the comedy. Sausage party is one of the movies with the strongest message. The plot is about grocery items who are sentient in a grocery store. They believe that when they are bought they go to food heaven, and are completely oblivious to the fact that they will be killed in brutal ways. IT really talks about how religion can have detrimental effects on society when they believe that there is a better life after death.

				<div class="col-xs-6 stuff">
					I am of Russian Jewish descent. I am not very religious if you couldn’t tell from my movies, but I don’t run away from my Jewishness. In “The Night Before” I wore a sweater with the star of david on it to show that I am Jewish, kind of like a nod to all the Jews in the audience. While I am not as apparent in my movies, I do wear Judaism with pride in the real world. For example, Ann Coulter made a tweet that referenced “F--ing Jews”, I responded with “you’re a horrible f**king idiot”. Even though I’m not religious and am not that close to Judaism, I stick with it though thick and thin.

				<div class="col-xs-6 stuff">
					<strong>Many people ask me to tell them the five biggest factors of my success, so here they are:</strong>
					
					<ol>
						<li><strong>First,</strong> my comedic talent, without talent I would have never been able to do the things that I do</li>
						<li><strong>Second,</strong> the fact that I took that talent and did something with it, many people have talents that they don’t ever use for anything, if you have a gift, use it! It might make you famous</li>
						<li><strong>Third,</strong> my friends when I was a child, I had friends who would listen to my ideas and help me develope them, I actually started  writing “Superbad” with a friends when I was in my teens</li>
						<li><strong>Fourth,</strong> my role in “Freaks and Geeks”, it was what made me an actor</li>
						<li><strong>Fifth,</strong> my role in “Knocked Up”, while my role in “Freaks and Geeks” made me an actor, this was the role than made me one of the most well known actors today</li>

				<div class="col-xs-6 stuff">
					If there was a life lesson to take away from everything that I have done over the years it would be to follow your dream. As I have mentioned before, I wouldn’t be where I am today if I had not done anything with my comedic talents. I know that it sounds cheesy to say “follow your dreams!”, but it’s not entirely wrong. I don’t mean that you should quit your job to try and become famous, that will almost never work out. Instead, start small. If you love acting, then join an improv group, or audition for a local play, something that you can do alongside everything else in your is the important part. I didn’t drop school when I won an Amature Comedy competition, I droped it when I got a role in “Freaks and Geeks”. You should follow your dream, but do it when you have some sort of gig, or something that you know will really help you get to where you want to be, not just a will.

					A charity that I have worked to support and promote is “Hilarity for Charity”. It’s a charity that is raising money to help cure, or at least better treat, alzheimer’s. Since it was created, Hilarity for charity has raised over 6.5 million dollars for our cause!
